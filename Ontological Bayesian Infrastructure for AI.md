Ontological Bayesian Infrastructure for AI



Hi uh everyone um today we're going to explore the um the OBI AI system or theological vision uh AI system uh which stands for the hot system AI system called OBI AI uh it's going to the system which mean hot in ebook uh the 3 vision AI system uh uh OB today we're going to look at the hypothesis uh for the project which is complet anyway uh to see whether them is solved or not. You know, uh we're going to see uh how the hypothesis have been addressed systematically. Uh what why why use OBI and the uh infrastructure as a service uh for through obsess.org uh you guys understand that uh the original is a polygon system continue something called OBI core and we're going to come back to the um bian infrastructure function core system uh which is OB system uh uh to orchestrates components for AI systems with an large language model core uh written in rust uh for processing large model features. So let's begin uh and see how we trace them side by side. One second. I would pause my screen. Okay. Now we're going to go through the the system. Now we're going to go through the proof like the hypothesis I made. I developed uh got the first hypothesis which was start. We got hypothesis one.1 uh solution versus unbiased model. Uh first of all uh OBI AI is intelligent Beijing infrastructure for AI or AI systems that are unbiased. Uh the Beijing is just uh using Beijing inference to uh reason uh in to make sure the AI reasons correctly. The problem that this model addresses is you know um is using something called um top down reasoning uh and bottom up reason to dictate uh how data resolve demographically. You know the thing is uh take example AI cancer detection system uh that detects AI uh that that takes detects AI uh that uh that cancer in people. Say you have a doctor who takes cancer in patient and this guy is uh let's say a black uh like me u black in the UK but you know I smoke a lot which is not true but let's for example I start smoking I do it a lot uh uh their system they system to detect my cancer uh because the system is biased traditionally bias you know uh because it's a demographic it's localized it's it doesn't generalize it generalizes based on uh I am uh you can't detect me because I am an outlier to say I am I am uh demographically uh u abound you know so if I was in Nigeria right now or or baref Nigeria um and I'm black um and a and a white and a caucasian uh enters the Nigeria and gets cancer smokes a lot drinks a lot he or she uh will then be uh intoxicated but still be the outline of that is uh don't know AI what the data set uh what OBI is much achieve is uh unbiased unbiased being unbiased uh in data modeling uh using uh and uh because we have a model of abnormality and normality because normal is like you know when something is normal it's just uh normal like normal means it's just accepted you know it's perceived as normal but we don't like is meant to be uh addressed uh this model you see on the screen is called see the model you see on the screen. Uh see this here, this model here, the black box model. It's it's really my opinion. Yes. Uh so this is emphasizing the black box model. Uh or or the black box. Uh see this this is a uh see this uh this is a black box uh uh black box here. Uh it's meant to address uh that kind of problem. Uh look this is a That's the black box trans. So when the input goes against the black can't see, we can't observe uh and because the black is inherently biased. It's just like bias uh it's biased. So you can't really understand uh uh what's going on how the model transforms bias input to bias output. Uh hence oi2. So this uh how the system works. Uh a good thing about this you can't really control this bias parameter. You can't control it. It's hard to control it. Uh now how OB this is from something with a co confounder. Uh the confounder is just the how the system processes information based on the input speed. You're just thinking about bias tuning. Think it as bias adjusting weights of that bias parameter uh to get uh um so data set and there's uh bias parameters here. Uh you know the input is biased. We have the bias parameters you have to address. Uh now the device are just the inputs that are to mitigate the bite you know how you want the options of the ear to address uh nuance in context like you know uh how do you want the ear to actually work uh the parameters and the input like the how how much is it and you get a device output um using top down and bottom up reasoning now I'm going to give you an example of when this bias parameter will apply uh based on the confounder uh the confounder is really So there's a there's a a case study that came up in Nigeria right now. People are in Nigeria are happier than people in the UK. This is a well search on the internet because you know that's the question is why do we have a health and social care system in the UK and people are not happy uh people are miserable or like more happier uh less because the ranked was ranked as Nigeria is ranked at the second uh happiest uh country. uh was it next to Niger I believe that EK is ranked 11th uh based on my the hierarchy uh I was so you know last 20 uh my my understanding is uh using subject model is that uh in Nigeria uh we get uh support uh from the community itself but not the government support you we get localized community support uh by friends by family uh but not directly from the government you know we get we do get because we do get some from government but you know we We just get directions. We don't get uh the full support in place but uh to address our problems. You know whether it's a housing problem, whether it's a shelter problem, what is a food supply problem. Uh the neighbors mingle to solve each other and everyone is satisfied and therefore happy. Uh now uh this is natural system, you know, social uh uh health social and housing system for young people or children. and they end up uh trying to go to the government for everything. Now the government has to do for them uh can't do for them uh based on can't do for don't actually address their needs and they're being directed uh everywhere there. Uh the co-founder or let's go to confounder hypothesis uh is really about um how that bottom up system uh works uh for how people are happy how an outcome is achieved. Okay. Is there some case that uh some some cultural case or some ambiguity uh some edge case some corner case has to address based on the base case as a foundation of you know is there nuance in understanding uh subjectively objectively you know just observing the world to address something to debiased you know because eutum U so uh wait do I have to say so uh we got uh uh two models uh we got top down reasoning and bottom up reasoning so uh top down reasoning is the idea that you start from a single source of truth uh and then reason your way downwards to using a a statement or claim you know uh um let's say example all swans are Okay. Uh let's say oh let's say so the same thing. So there's the different models of reasoning. I've never seen a black swan. Therefore, all souls are white. That's a that's a truth. You can ad it's a hypothetical. It's a hypothetical. It's like it does work in context, you know, and can use subjective reason. That's objective reasoning called top top down reasoning because everyone has not seen a black swan or the infamous um Hercules is a man. Therefore, I can't remember that. Yes, that's the original. Therefore, we got your model uh as a basic model you know based on the input data set or the amount of um man you see or the amount of uh uh swans you see that's a white or black uh so that's the confounder hypothesis you know and we got the subject one like you know like you know uh since I've never or uh since I've never encountered a white black black sword all sws are you know or is it like a you know and that's like a reason of the bottom up subjective objective but that's an easy way to relate to it. uh it's meant to be using reasoning systems. How the the base case for that reasoning or the bottom up analogy how the system uh what's the foundation to that system? Uh which is the bottom up way or the top down system to reason that output to the device that data. Uh now no now um you know we have qualitative data and quantitive data. Quality refer to the uh uh quality uh the data set uh like you know cats, dogs which are data regarding animals or like uh like or like wallets uh colors you know uh things you can quantify uh based on their properties you know what you observe quantitative data uh um what we're getting at here is uh top down reason and bottom reason are used to address uh the uh a bias and a bias output you know in a unified source cost uh unified approach to the biased output you know because you can get a data set we still get the bias output and this is the principle the bias uh so we got the hyping uh so so when you train an AI system when you train an AI uh when you system you are really training as pattern recognizer you are you really training it as a as a kind of pattern recognizer uh you know it's going in it's a pattern and that pattern is being amplified you know you go in here it becomes a pattern uh and uh then you get a bias prediction and you get a bias out uh that's what it's saying so you see this step so it goes back feedback. So this goes here AI is bi biases uh patterns pattern matches. Uh that's not what you want. You want to uh not make sure they understand how to reason not just match uh to resolve context of problems. Uh so that's what that's a hypothesis that says uh why AI can crash because it's looking for patterns in data uh to or singular. So you know if you have if you have an AI car you know it's looking for patterns in its own data set to address that problem you know I would never let the AI car drive me if it just works on pattern matching you know because it can match a wrong person or what is known as a false negative a false positive uh so we have a standard structure we got the OB says uh legal so we got true positive uh the AI matches correctly uh true positive uh is true and the AI is true false positive uh the AI is false uh which is the matrix we got true negative I mean false negative which means uh the AI falsely uh identify is negative negatively identify as falsely oh sorry a false positive so the AI cons it's an error so you got true negative true true positive yes true means uh the EI fails to uh and these are all problems for each uh question each address to address uh the sound. This is called a QA matrix. Uh uh QA matrix stands for quality assurance. Uh is a P of soundness have this this AI system is this sound? Does it not match catch? Is it meant to address the four cases true positive, true negative, false positive, and that is what I'm saying. If you go to github.com legal, you can read about the QA matrix or the quality assurance. When people say quality assurance testing, they're talking about uh test during development uh of quality of code not just quantity of the code you write um because you're not trusting you're testing all the case indefinitely of the test you're testing the quality of that code um that you wrote uh based on what you developed you know not just writing a test test test which is called a QA test uh which is TDD or testdriven development life cycle pattern uh it's not a it's not a BDD although it can apply BDD because BDD testing is a behavior different development. If you apply BDD uh the best way to just use is uh just test without tested BDD uh to do is use TDD uh to develop artifacts uh with integration test uh unit test respectively. Uh you don't have to take do uh system testing uh but you know that's what that means uh QA matrix. Uh so that's the battery. So this is a bias person matching uh input. This is just an example. So you got the input uh these bias models. Um you see that's what it means. This is completely done. Uh so you got the epoch uh training do eco for each sample of data set given an element. Do you compute you know this is just biasing how this works. You don't want this in your code. It's just a bias organization of the pattern matching uh algorithm. So we go hypothesis three. Now it's hypothesis 3.1 and 2.3. Uh so uh hypothesis 3.1 states uh 31 uh yes uh hypo 31 is just uh concept of unboxing uh the g of unboxing uh box refers to the concept of gathering the data how the data how the how the AI processes the inputs uh unboxing refers to uh unboxing data data or sorting our data to gain uh like a map of understanding you know whether it's a 2D map or 3D map of that information set you know where does this fit into the cluster of information how do I characterize this thing I already know if he's talking about uh if he's talking about cooking is it he's talking about cleaning you know because you know that's what the news is meant to understand so how this works um uh it's meant to work so we have the concept of 4D tenza if you're familiar with machine learning modules uh 4D tens uh represent uh inner monologue you know our brain our processing of 4D in our brain that's how it works is this kind of 4D relationship uh to to work uh the 4D is the model of the system so how dimensional reduction works it's very important to understand this how dimensional reduction works you take a uh say you are making a 3D game uh uh 3D game uh so if So if you're uh if you are using a dimension regression you have to reduce that state. So you got a 4D tensor uh the 4D t just uh it's just a parameter here. So uh if you define d uh let's call it uh d for dimensional dr uh uh uh uh dr n Sorry. And uh uh what is the sorry? Okay. Um, drd equals uh dr uh uh the equals uh n minus one d uh okay you know you know what you know I'm just going to try to do some formalization here. So what I'm saying to you is we got um to understand that this the whatever whatever instruction whatever your model using when you have a something called the magnitude um uh so this is the formula I want just remember you know this uh Uh so so dr refers to the dimension it's just a function of dimension uh equals d minus one you know you know that's what you're trying to do um the this is just magnitude like you know the magnitude of that dimension minus one you know you got to remove a dimension uh which is just what is it saying so the dr refers to the dimension reduction of the systemus one this is a very practice to do um you want your AI system to able to create a 3D map of the information you know whether it's a 3D game you give it a 3D if it's a 3D game uh and you want it to process in real time you use a 4D tensor to model that and then uh transform that data uh within dimension reduction or unboxing uh unboxing is a concept of like you know the system of unboxing structure unboxing and unboxing uh structural unboxing refers to uh the structure of doing where you want the to understand uh formally or something. The structure of the data is meant to be uh uh structured you know whether it's input is unstructured in say just go in session to structure data in a way that it can be processed further you know this mative process to it can be processed like a brainstorming using K and clustering uh K and clustering refers to um it's an algorithm from graph theory to cluster information into categories uh Not by I J by by by by K. K inverse not a K degree just means uh reduce that to the AB 2D 3D 4D system K clustering is uh is a graph theory method where you clust information based on category uh it's not just it's not uh it's not the nearest neighbor hypo next nearest neighbors you know just to categorize data based on uh what they are meant to achieve for the information set uh in the neuron of the brain you know it's So it can be processing information uh coherently not just matching patterns you know it can index weather information based on the category you've created too. So the K and clustering is really about uh reducing to the end the K dimension uh I J K where K I represents the uh uh the I axis uh the X-axis the Y the Z ais or the map and then the K represent the 3D map you know K 3 plus three map 3D uh so if you have 4D tensor you have a uh AI system in a game or in the real world you have to understand uh uh the 3D map uh it's just it's on what it's interpreting directly what is noticing you know in that game you know uh what is tracking in a game and that gives it uh that can beatic what you can now you can find out how what you can now have automatic understanding uh you now got unstructuring uh say you have like the same data coming from the internet and you now use for you can this allow to uh AI to create new solutions to problems you know something called dimensional game theory. which is my dimension game refers to the concept of using dimensions uh offense defense attack uh to strategically address problems not just linear bound matching or uh it's meant to uh um it's dimensional game theory is about the real world spaces uh actively using to solve semantic filter of flash uh understand systems like that uh that dimension it's dimension so your strategy you have is in dimension. So take chess for example uh chess refers to uh uh you know the the standal mother of is chess you know if someone plays say you have two players in chess I'm trying to give the dimension game theory concept uh two players and they play a perfect game there'll be no victor there'll be no determinism victor uh the game will end in a draw that's determinism so there'll be no winner because they're paid perfectly dimensional game theory it says uh if there's an offense, defense, and attack uh a strategy. And one person uh deploys a strategy like a flank like a and get to giving some pieces of this just one piece. Uh they can they have an anchor to win that game, they can win that game because they they they went ahead to not play a perfect game or do the most optimal move. Uh but you know, if they can do it, but using strategy to address that problem, hence the dimensional game theory. So I'm see my AS play chess too maybe on chest and old but you know that's how dimension gi it's about uh uh creating these things called dimensions addressing problems for that strategy you're trying to deploy you know whether it's an AI uh strategy or like a strategy that affect us so this rule you have to remember the drd equals d minus one uh so that's the dimension every time you have a using a five using a five dimensional tensor uh you a four dimensional tensor and sword and so on till you get the output. You compare you map clear output to the input and output which is a 3D for the 4D 4D you know a dimension less uh you can uh apply dimension uh recursively uh on the on a step on on this side on this step here can apply indefinitely but you know the goal is to smack it on standard and smack your reasoning. Uh so this is the algorithm structural unboxing. Uh yes this you get the inputs for the for but this unstructured unboxing which is the unstructured uh if you're working with the unstructured data uh you want the ATB to process that data uh just on the internet use of formals or you want some uh uh uh structured data structural just refers to uh uh uh data structure uh structured data if you're working from the uh tables or rows or like uh data hierarchical data you can use structural unboxing to get inside the data we built the hypothesis 3 model. So this is the the hypothesis this OBI code for uh function call system uh modular so we got you see this uh we got voice interface so we got the base LLM call this base LLM code is to be written in rust rust.exe which is a programming language uh so so this the llm you know you can now have a uh the FFI uh of the OBO system uh which is Cisco or OB to speak to the uh base L to have the vision model, the accessibility feature, the voice interface and the robust interface. uh this allow you to literally just uh develop features that can be evolve and adapt which is uh thing we will do try to code but this is a poly system it allows you to talk to any language using rust so when you get something called OBI codeex uh you are using that to talk to Python for your voice interface node for robot user interface uh python accessibility etc for interface you know and this can be enabled and disabled on the fly by the user want to interpret the system after being downloaded on the AI system they use it. Maybe it's a drone, maybe it's a AI system, maybe it's a car system, but this allows it to be downloaded and work virtually anywhere. Yep. Uh so this is the input output. So let's go to the other document now. So this uh so okay so now I'm going to uh talk about more about the filter flash and uh let me see. Okay, I want to give you this one. Yeah. Um, this one will be I just sum up this one. So, this is like uh uh the filter flash uh so OBS was in works in something called the filter flash architecture. Uh the filter flash architecture refers to uh how we know or how we know what we know. Uh which is called epistemic uh reasoning. Uh epistemic uh meaning do I know? How do I know? How do I know what how am I show? How do I know? How can I check? You know this is filtering uh is a classical model. Uh filtering refers to the uh sorting out of information and like uh processing. Flash refers to the concept of storing information in a cohes remembering it basically you know so that's what flash you know like structured this is just storing that data but you know in a manner like you know uh package like you know like a structured store refers to the concept of uh uh storing that data that has got in a way that can easily process back again you know filter flashes know whether it's a new insight or not uh the must be able to cohesively remember it and load any time. Uh flashing refers to uh the process of uh gaining new insight. Uh let me give you an example. Say uh say you have a child you know you know you have a child you have a young ch child you know make sure so this how it works. So the one second um one second let me just one second. So um how the AI system works is something called epistemic reasoning. It's me how do I know what I know? Uh so this works with something called uh my DAG uh asyclic DAG or direct asyclic graph and uh you know using the filter flash filtering means uh uh understanding what you're understanding what you understand and then flashing it means storing memory uh understanding this. So let me give you an analogy. Um so say you have like a a child let's give a child example example I have I have a girl I don't have any daughter but you know I don't I don't have children uh so we have like a first one is mostly objective it can be objective or subjective but you know say you have like a a puzzle a puzzle a puzzle piece uh yep a puzzle piece uh one one centime wide you have a rojo rim uh to place that great in a on a you know you give up but you know can do it eventually. But filtering is like uh sorting. How do I sort who do I what do I put here to actually uh uh place how do I start organizing this uh puzzle on the floor? So it's a conscious model. It's like a model of cognition consciousness. How we aware when you start processing the filtering you then do a flash uh you didn't flash it. Ah some kind of you have a recap moment. Okay. This goes here. This goes here. This gets and you get Yes. Now you go back to go to starting again. Now I got this piece. Am I right? Now you get clear picture of what you do. You can get a can try to find the first corner piece. Uh if you really try to go optimal and work from the corner outwards, you know, that's the most everybody's strategy. The simplest you can take. Uh get a find a first corner piece. Uh and then get that room to organize and you can start flashing it. Uh but you can but you can do that to call the flashing you know. uh you know flinging or fashion you know fling just means sorting but if you take a flash you take any piece you just start just find any random fleet uh and you try to build your way up to a solution to the full image whether it's a space rocket or something more uh just a space rocket you know and you get a space you know a view from space of space and the planet uh the planet system you know that's the you're making uh now that's what it is you know cautious and adapting it. That's why we like this model of system. It can adapt to any system meaning that its web intent you know whether you are because you know why we have consciousness in the first place. Consciousness is a static thing. It allows you to dynamically learn from from your experiences and the world around you. Uh and that's the filter flash activation. It's meant to uh conscious of being aware uh uh objectively subjectively uh you know uh you know the thing about uh uh system when we work on bias systems biased AI systems is that uh when we buy because you can uh tailor for everyone it's easy to tailor for without getting bottled down on the nuances and work for any demographic basically in China Japan uh we have like uh um one more thing that so how they actually go to flash flash photo you get up then yeah listens to you or talks to you he learns more about you what is you AI which is uh which is really uh we have something a term called actor the actor term is is not an agent so the to act on your behalf you know to make a request or do something on your behalf what is request uh when you're writing an email send it to my coworker about be nice you know you can on your behalf to go and send an email or postpone something or do something in in the real world on the internet being unbiased. Uh no, we're not building what represents or the intelligent infraction for AI system you can always adapt and evolve it like any other system you know it's not just monolithic it's nonal you can use a python binder like pi OBI to pi OB to net uh speak to uh network interfaces uh or node or or raster or you have a right rece you know it allows you to adapt uh now about the IAS platform IAS platform stands for infrastructure as a service and that's where all the poly system lives so if you go to uhs uh obexuscomputing.org uh that's the website I'm going to use to ship deploy uh the system uh replaces a public system that's for the is the page user service to use all the certific as a service. It's the infrastructure the poly infraure you can pay for such as polyore if you want to pay for services for your business uh to to achieve some kind of uh but it's a pay as you go service you can uh use to purchase uh used to automate your system. Uh so the D resolution is important because you know when you filter you flash you have to filter and flash. The D is meant to say using something called verb noun concept. Now uh one more thing the verb noun concept is very important to this uh because you know the simpler model of concept is called a verb noun pair you know it's not really a concept it's just like a select thing like think speeding car speeding car is the is just a concept uh slowing car or breaking car is Same concept breaking car speeding car. These are two concept that verb is speeding and noun is verb. Verbs are speeding and uh breaking and the noun car of the object. Uh yep. uh which is in real life using social unboxing because already there but if you want to use unboxing to generally use it use can build a flying car you know and that's what you can say how do I build a flying car you start to be more formal you know and you talk to yeah this how you may be the final car but you have to be careful you know here because you know blah blah and that unstructured unboxing to uh depict how that model will work in the real world you know we're trying to get the ear to be creative and so problems actually be useful uh uh I'm not sport people but to be a pessimatic actor to act to do a talks whether you see the calendar notes uh the yeah here is called you say you yeah you know you know it's you but it's yourself what you tell it is what you what you get you know but it's meant to solve your problem being a computer system yes so the dark is just a direct cycle that lives among the two layers of fast car speeding car and breaking car to resolve a concept. Now when you get two concept that two two pairs two or more pairs two three or more pairs that's a verb now concept that uh concept of fast cars or speeding cars or or breaking car now generalize among vehicles you cannot say that car to fast bus uh uh breaking bus I mean speeding bus breaking bus or speeding motorcycle if you're talking about if you're speaking about uh motor vehicle or bicycles or things that move, you know, things that have action associated with them. Uh, but to move uh, you know, in these are called taxonomy pairs, which is my concept of verb noun pairs. Uh, verb noun concept pairs refers to the concept uh, you use to rectify a situation through formal it's a formal concept modeling system for AI to understand how the AI system should not should approach the problem not just crash by pattern machine. uh what concept can I use to explore what's happening here in real time uh and that's what trying to explore uh so state of being aware uh and the subjective reason I believe to address this with dimensional game theory uh what's your theory of u of um dimensions to strategies in dimension offense defense attack that you depict yourself for that set problem uh what you tackling it's a very flexible Now we go to one more thing about say you have a system uh say you now have a dimension grip to use say you have like a signal a tuning system an input system uh this input is meant to tune a slider so you go you know all those airplanes you know say you're making an automatic airplanes you have a system for looking at impulse weather and you want the system to know how to fly this plane now you want the air to learn learn uh but you know when it's flying when the system learns enough it will then come back to the ground and but you know you don't want to play able to put autoplay auto play it's uh what you want all the dashboard of the EI systems of the systems are like uh buttons and dials which is a very complex system we try to reduce that complexity uh to make sure the inputs are on the system can be uh found on the plane so when is flying on find people want to make sure the auto plane is just a safe place to go. So when you put the when it's landing the system flies that plane lands the plane but the impression that the mission gives is the input orchestration like you know how the inputs become output you know what you know because you know if autopilot you don't want to give maybe have a degree of to give some permission to do something until the is achieved uh but what the system should have you know have a dial that uh like a radio dial uh to tune signal to tune signals. Uh that's the thing. Uh when you tune a signal, you are really uh you're really changing many options. Uh you know, until you get a picture, it's not just like switch to uh because it's an it's an analog wave you are changing. Uh so that's what it says. The mission game theory is meant to be for me to capture the nuances of understanding to address that problem. And that's what dimension creator holds you know if I make a slider up and down and it works in inputs it's analog analog or digital uh you can go it can go levels like that or it can be in modes basically like a level of gas system or you can be uh you can be in a in a fluidity of states uh depending on the what you want to have you know we want to control the plane uh just by being in modes uh with limited option. It reduce like you know reduce the input space uh and reduce the AI to make less mistakes uh uh when changing gears or against the two plier pushes in the cockpit uh uh slowly out of the way using a fl observation and that's what the OBI is. a reflection of me uh my condition my thinking uh that I put on paper uh to make sure that it's uh it's coherent. Now you can change the proof on github.com nexusp nts which is github.com which obx patatterents uh just look at the pattern disclaimer just comment but you know it's 25 years patents yeah but you guys can read the proof and I I don't know but I haven't really p you know just just look at the proofs just just read the proof and see whether it's coherent to you uh the uh PDF documents uh so you can go to github.com/obics patatterents uh read the formal uh proofs. Um yes uh one more thing uh um you know when we have the AI systems uh AI is here already uh system you have to uh understand that uh one more let me give you an say you have a a small daughter a daughter a little girl not a daughter maybe you know your daughter maybe some daughter and you wanted to objectively understand what you're saying uh how this actually works you know you give it five colors she said uh and teaching her the colors of rainbows Richard gave battle in vain but you don't tell her the color you wanted learn objectively. So you said um and you don't tell her. So she said she said you give her the color names but you don't tell her which color you want. So you said uh this is blue uh blue for blue you know and she just look at the colors that the names text you know and that teach the AI okay yes this is blue uh using trial and improvement trial and error to uh address that scenario. So when you when she picks a long color you then uh take that color out uh and let it try again. That's what you want to give the AI to understand what is the concept you're trying to explore you know not just showing a blend images that's objective reasoning model using dimensional game theory uh so you want the to be during training uh training is very important using unsupervised training unsupervised learning so unsupervised learning refers to the concept of uh letting it try again and coming back later to see that result supervised learning is like uh saying uh uh so give this do the test and then super supervis like you know I'm going to change I'm going to watch your inputs uh I'm going to change to see what output you give me I'm going to supervise you get the right output uh yep uh and then we got uh supervised learning then we got unsupervised learning which is the concept of um uh not supervising the AI to do something you know like you know you do more like uh uh test but you don't supervise the AI in the tra you let the air do the test come concepts explore that problem using the group theory and then unsupervised make sure it's doing that job reinforcement layer which which is really generative AI systems that take the input and go back to input output you know you know it forces itself what it knows based on the new data set uh do I understand what I understand do I not understand what I don't understand you know understand this clearly based on the QA matrix uh so that's what I'm saying so you know uh when is real world We also deploy a 95.4 metric uh um scam system. You know how this works is uh for the conscious model you know for vacation you know this like a test to regulate uh real world AI you know things that operate in the real world not in your bedroom uh but you know things that drive trains uh wrong place you know because you know it's meant to be uh it's meant to be safe what safe AI 95.4% 4% uh 95 for both suspense is useful here. It's going to be a benchmark everything you know 95 refers to 95% refers to the clamping radius you know uh for the conscious model we understanding the concept around it uh properly before is deployed you know this is a pass using the QA matrix true positive false positive force negative force positive you know uh that's what the ear is going to be doing uh and then the 4% is like you know if I do if I do if If I if I don't understand by four by four but four you know and I round down I'm a bit frustration I round to 95%. So it's like if it's 95% it's a clamp it's clamp between 95 and 100% uh of the cor understanding while it's driving in the real world why it's flying a plane in the real world why it's uh riding while you while the ear is on the auto plate you know that's what the percent understand now the sub model um which I didn't say uh before for the music when you get a little girl to um to internalize the colors so you give her you can say you kind uh write something up down about that color. You know what she knows. Uh this is and she says uh uh you give her a note to get this color this this meant to be this kind of color. You know uh give her hints too. You can give a hint but until she subject to understand that this is red, this is green, this is blue uh you know using dimension game theory uh which is a strategist to get to understand something in context. Now the dimension game theory is meant to address kind of problems. Uh it can address dimensional problems or it's not just game theory. Uh uses to address problems in war problems in uh AI system health system organ failure uh uh big systems basically uh and that's what the logical vision infrastructure for AI represents. Okay. Now uh thank you for watching. like, share and watch his videos. Uh you can go to github.com/ob when it's complete but it's going to be written in rust. Uh but the proof is ready. Uh you can check it out yourself. You can download the repository. Uh but don't steal my work. Okay. Thank you. Attribute me. Attribute me when you do. Thank you. Bye-bye.
