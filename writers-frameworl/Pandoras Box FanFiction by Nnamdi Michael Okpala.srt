00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,070
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Okay, guys, this video is very important to

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:06,310
me.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,710
It's just one thing I have to make

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,030
today.

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,650
Okay, guys, guys, I will not become what

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,590
soul to break me.

7
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,250
I will build what kind of healer soul.

8
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,370
You know, that's the policy on my system.

9
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,550
That's the very important policy.

10
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,610
That's the very important thing is that you

11
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,050
need it.

12
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:20,850
You don't want it.

13
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:21,510
You need it.

14
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,810
Any new implementation that goes through in the

15
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,210
very important thing is just like feed or

16
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,190
the shelter for housing.

17
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,670
You need that, you know, stability, you know.

18
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,730
There's no, human rights are getting better, but,

19
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,950
you know, the law and order around it

20
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:32,510
is getting better.

21
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,150
So, basically, I got my poem here.

22
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:34,950
It's not poem.

23
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:35,770
It's my story.

24
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:36,670
I got it here.

25
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:38,890
Look, guys, look at this.

26
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,130
I got to read this thoroughly.

27
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,030
I got to understand it.

28
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,230
You know, this, I'm okay holding up.

29
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,670
You got to understand what it really means

30
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,170
to me.

31
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,770
I'm going to cry about it.

32
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,530
I'm not going to cry about it, but

33
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,670
it's going to be about my history in

34
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,170
Nigeria and everything.

35
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,890
I'm going to give you the metaphysical, what's

36
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,150
it called?

37
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,930
That's all the story you want.

38
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,090
I'm going to read it.

39
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:58,930
I'm going to read it.

40
00:00:59,090 --> 00:00:59,590
I'm going to give you the message.

41
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,890
Now, this story is called Pandora's Box.

42
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,450
Pandora's Box, a fan section by me, Namdi.

43
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:06,150
Okay.

44
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,970
Okay.

45
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,570
So, basically, I'm going to read this story.

46
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,570
I'm going to give you the other one.

47
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,790
But the goal of this is to have

48
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,390
more oral seal.

49
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,610
So, basically, this is an oral seal message.

50
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,870
It's like, you know, we have a private

51
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:15,870
key, not a public key.

52
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,210
You know, like, you know, the public keys

53
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:18,670
are the messages.

54
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,170
You know, the messages, you know, can be

55
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,190
like, the public keys can be like a

56
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:22,650
bliss poem.

57
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,150
But it's one message.

58
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,310
This is an oral seal for me.

59
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,670
But it's something called the reticle, like, you

60
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,290
know, in the reticle.

61
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,570
Like, you know, it's just rhetoric.

62
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,290
It means that you say a lot, but

63
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:33,850
it's just rhetoric.

64
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,530
You know, it doesn't mean anything.

65
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,050
It can mean something, but it doesn't have

66
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,810
to be, because it's just based on the

67
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,350
talk and what's going on at that time.

68
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,730
You know, it can mislead you, because it's

69
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:42,970
reticle.

70
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,070
It's not really the truth.

71
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,010
It can be somewhat true, but not true.

72
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:46,510
You get it.

73
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,410
But it's reasoning, about reasoning.

74
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,150
My own reasoning, the rationale behind doing it,

75
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,090
why are you doing that thing?

76
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,670
You know, why are you trying to adjust

77
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,570
the grand scheme of things at a small

78
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:55,870
scale?

79
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,110
You know, the minimal election alone.

80
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,670
This is an oral seal message I'm going

81
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,310
to give to you.

82
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,310
That's, you know, it's just that way.

83
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,190
I mean, how much does your lawsuit?

84
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,210
My lawsuit is $360 million.

85
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,270
I have to go to Cambridge to get

86
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,630
it.

87
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,770
But I have to go to Cambridge College,

88
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,930
because the Roth Code said no to me.

89
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,050
So basically, I'm building a legacy here, but

90
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,890
I'm doing it the right way.

91
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,550
I'm not like a rebellion in the wrong

92
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,730
way.

93
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,690
You know, I want to do my PhD

94
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,310
in the UK, but I don't think I

95
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:17,870
can do it no more.

96
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,450
And I don't want to go through the

97
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:19,670
bureaucracy.

98
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,630
But this story is really important to me.

99
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,350
It really means something to me.

100
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,330
Okay, okay, guys, let's just begin, because AutoAI,

101
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,910
oh, wait, oh, AutoAI is never recording.

102
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,050
Anyway, let's just begin, because this system is

103
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,450
kind of not recording, not recording.

104
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,110
Okay, it's not recording.

105
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,270
It must have stopped.

106
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,870
Anyway, anyway, it's not recording AutoAI.

107
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,130
And that's the problem.

108
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,130
Anyway, I've got my audio book.

109
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,910
Okay, no, no, no.

110
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,050
Okay.

111
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,510
Today is the Pandora's box.

112
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,570
Today, I will not become what is supposed

113
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,090
to break me.

114
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,830
I will heal, or heal us, or build

115
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,430
or heal us.

116
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,230
And that's part of all the policy systems.

117
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,750
If I'm ending as an invariant, I go

118
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,910
through the policy, I must heal itself.

119
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,130
You need to follow through with no education.

120
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,450
But I'm not supporting a lot of these

121
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:06,610
things.

122
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,490
Okay, this Pandora's box, my take, my fanfiction.

123
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:10,110
Okay.

124
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:17,970
The lady, Pandora, today, okay, today, okay, the

125
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:24,230
lady stared just at the box, never, I

126
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,790
was told, never to open it.

127
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,270
The box was these, the weapon, the evil.

128
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,550
She looked at, she looked at it.

129
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,630
She was, because the matter is ready, it's

130
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,390
already just right now.

131
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,070
That's what I'm really important.

132
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:40,790
She looked at it, she has a gaze

133
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,710
that her wonder about it, pondered about it.

134
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,610
And why her husband never told her to

135
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,290
open the box.

136
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,350
She was curious, Pandora.

137
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,230
She wanted to open the box, but she

138
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:53,630
never did.

139
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,470
Because of her husband, you know, the box

140
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,110
was open, was never to open.

141
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,230
It was sealed with locks and chains.

142
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,810
And I'm meeting because I'm making it up

143
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,690
because I'm going with the flow.

144
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,630
Pandora was to keep it in secret, to

145
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,750
hide it from the public view, and to

146
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,690
never show it or tell about it.

147
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:28,220
She was powerful, she was as powerful as

148
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,400
the man, as the husband, but she was

149
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:31,740
a woman.

150
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,120
She had a womb, she had to protect

151
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,500
and serve in other ways, but her husband

152
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,740
instructed Pandora to guard the box.

153
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,200
One day 25 years later, Pandora is 25,

154
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,460
by the way, her husband's friend came and

155
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,840
asked Pandora, your husband, have you seen him?

156
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,820
Have you heard of him?

157
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,360
Have you heard the news?

158
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,160
She answered, no, no, I've never seen him.

159
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,020
My husband came one week, in one week,

160
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,680
and talking to me one week ago, one

161
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,380
week before, he gave me this after fact,

162
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,640
he calls the box, and never opened it,

163
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,600
because she's 25, she's 15 now, and she

164
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,500
never opened it.

165
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,780
She answered to him, oh yes, the box,

166
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,060
yes, yes, why the box?

167
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,960
He said, she's kind of curious, she never

168
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,900
knew about it, you know, and the woman,

169
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,620
yes, yes, I know about that box too,

170
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,580
and the man replied, yes.

171
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,400
But he said, I should never, I'm not

172
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,840
going to talk about it, I don't know

173
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,720
nothing about any box, Pandora replied, she lied.

174
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,000
Then the husband says, don't worry, I got

175
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,340
evidence for you.

176
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,260
The husband's friend asked him, asked her, to

177
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,400
give away, that she's going to give him

178
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,880
all the keys to the box, to open

179
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,780
it.

180
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,620
Pandora, what?

181
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,340
You have keys to the box?

182
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,840
You know what this box contains?

183
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,540
Yes, but the husband replied, I have bad

184
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,040
news too.

185
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:12,320
Your husband, the Pandora's box says, yes, you're

186
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,060
my husband, what?

187
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,620
It's deceased, he died in the war.

188
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,880
What war?

189
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,480
I'm not sure of a war.

190
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,940
Oh Pandora, I'm sorry to tell you, but

191
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,960
your husband's deceased in the war, in the

192
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,380
war, the war happened one week before.

193
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:35,880
What?

194
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,760
Yes, didn't you hear it in the news?

195
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,220
Yes, the war happened one week before, they

196
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,620
had to go to the war.

197
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,480
The butterflies in the battlefield had to cease

198
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,480
your husband, he's deceased now.

199
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,160
But that was 25 years ago, he died

200
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,140
on the front lines.

201
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,880
So Pandora asked why he died on the

202
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,960
front lines, what happened?

203
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,960
Oh, the husband replied, it was a tragedy,

204
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,460
he got caught in the midst of the

205
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,020
madness and the chaos and the fire.

206
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,540
But that box was his seal, was his

207
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,840
aura, but he didn't abide by what was

208
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,940
there, set in stone, or do his job.

209
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,180
He was part of the royal monarchs, as

210
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,520
you know, he was part of the king's

211
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:18,620
leadership.

212
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,700
He was the one with the keys to

213
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,700
unlock the box.

214
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,980
And what Pandora replied?

215
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,620
He panicked.

216
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,380
So what's on the box?

217
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,640
The husband gave her the keys, the husband's

218
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,980
friend, sorry, gave her the keys.

219
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,980
And then gave Pandora at the time the

220
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,720
relief to do it in peace in her

221
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,520
own time.

222
00:07:50,700 --> 00:08:00,460
The friend replied, your husband's aura

223
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,420
has not been sealed.

224
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,700
What does that mean?

225
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:06,780
Pandora asked.

226
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,260
You are part of the monarchs, part of

227
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,280
the most powerful family, that means the kings.

228
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,040
We have military control.

229
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,380
How could this have happened?

230
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,380
Pandora asked.

231
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,140
Pandora panicked and screamed.

232
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,120
And grabbed the keys on the structure man

233
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,220
to open the box containing Ashita Katan.

234
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,520
And his friends said, yes, here are the

235
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,860
artefacts to unlock this box.

236
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,539
It was sealed for a reason.

237
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,600
You need the time.

238
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,659
You need to radically reason, rational, about this.

239
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,020
You need to take your time to look

240
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,120
at the seal, to see why your husband's

241
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,740
seal was not sealed, and why his Christian's

242
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,080
master said no.

243
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,780
She thought just one week before, she heard

244
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,520
news about the war, and she read the

245
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,940
stories about the war with the newspaper article

246
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,640
in the box.

247
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,160
She opened it, and she saw that.

248
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,080
And then one week before there was a

249
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,780
war, before the war was announced, the next

250
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,920
week there was a war, the visual war.

251
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,920
She told nothing of it.

252
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,920
But then she opened the box to find

253
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,480
her husband was a military leader in the

254
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,620
war, in the colonial power system.

255
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,680
And she was his wife.

256
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,940
Now she's his spouse.

257
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,880
50 years later, she was 15 years old.

258
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,920
It's kind of interesting.

259
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,320
But she seems all her husband's power did

260
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,220
nothing to protect her and her legacy, or

261
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,420
the royalist petition of the people or the

262
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,160
corruption in Nigeria.

263
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,000
In the making, the legend of the making,

264
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,380
she threw the keys, and with the camera,

265
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:53,860
it's 25 years, November 2014 to 2011, 25.

266
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,900
With the camera, she opened the box to

267
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,160
see what her husband had sealed.

268
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,820
Guys, the box is sealed, because that's the

269
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,280
only thing he did.

270
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,540
And he went to do the job of

271
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,000
the human rupture.

272
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,700
25 years later, opened the keys, took the

273
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,560
box, and evil.

274
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,460
And she saw the news, the weapons, the

275
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,160
nuclear codes that was meant to be instructed

276
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,740
and guided and used according to the principle

277
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,520
of the protocol and the mortals, the missiles,

278
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,700
and the secret talks that was meant to

279
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,220
be accomplished.

280
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,300
But her brother was ignorant.

281
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,240
He didn't do this.

282
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,120
After confusion, after confusion, her husband started to

283
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,580
cry and would tears.

284
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,760
But why?

285
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,240
She knows enough.

286
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,360
She was confused about her husband and why

287
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,940
he didn't act.

288
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,560
But he did act, she thought.

289
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,000
She was confused.

290
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,660
She was paranoid.

291
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,260
But he went, but he never came back.

292
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,120
And next to confusion, she looked herself in

293
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,120
the mirror, when she got her box from

294
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,640
her house.

295
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,420
And she was concerned, shocked, and she began

296
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,260
to cry, tears.

297
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,820
She's going to look herself in the mirror,

298
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,880
a reflection of her soul, her spirit, or

299
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,700
her soul, you know, as a child, you

300
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,600
know, who she was.

301
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,540
She cried.

302
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,940
She stared at herself.

303
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,760
She became what?

304
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,460
Broke them.

305
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:32,020
The change started with them, but now I

306
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,320
transcend that change with us.

307
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,040
That's me.

308
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,460
Guys, that's what an oral seal means.

309
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,100
You know, that's just an example.

310
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,060
These guys have put that, these two oral

311
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,880
seals like this, so basically, as a child,

312
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,680
I go through the broken system, blah, blah,

313
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,620
to reflection of myself, of what is yet

314
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,280
to be and become.

315
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,340
I became, as an adult, an adult of

316
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,900
journey back to becoming a king, because what

317
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,760
am I trying not to do with others?

318
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,680
I'm an adult, 25.

319
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,300
I'm going with Nigeria.

320
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,880
I don't have a house in the UK.

321
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,520
I don't really care.

322
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,940
But I'm a British Nigerian passport.

323
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,380
As an adult, I go back to the

324
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,480
broken system to, yo, fix that thing.

325
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,560
And that's all the broken infrastructure there.

326
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,940
You know, this is Pandora's box by me.

327
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,900
And I'm the brother.

328
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,480
The change started with them, but I transcend

329
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,620
that change with us.

330
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,140
I will not be, also, to break me.

331
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,880
I will build, work in your soul.

332
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,580
And that is the world's first life, work,

333
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,960
constitution, live, work, breath constitution.

334
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,560
You know, you live there, you work there,

335
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,360
you breathe there.

336
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,400
You know, there's no, there's no structure.

337
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,080
The infrastructure is broken, and it's against you

338
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,760
by design.

339
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,060
By design, not by, not even by the

340
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,100
token, not only by direct construction, but how

341
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,180
it's built is fragmented.

342
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:40,980
It's fragmented.

343
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,040
For me, this is, like, how I want

344
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,240
to do it.

345
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,300
Because I see problems in Italy.

346
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,260
You know, I see patterns in the city.

347
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,780
There can be problems, you know.

348
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,040
I can reach my way through the system,

349
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,940
but you guys can't.

350
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,140
You know, you just have a battery in

351
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:52,360
the green cup.

352
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,340
You don't have to mess up.

353
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,500
This is my will.

354
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,800
I'm going to move again.

355
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,260
This is my lawsuit.

356
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,960
This is what it means.

357
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,560
You know, it wasn't my wife, you know.

358
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,640
And this happened to me.

359
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,540
I would tell my wife, like, you know,

360
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,460
if that's the one I care about, I

361
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,320
don't have a wife or a friend or

362
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:05,900
girlfriend, you know.

363
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,820
I would tell her, look, this box is

364
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,180
very open.

365
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,660
But don't keep it in secret.

366
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,320
You know, if I die or something happens,

367
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,020
you must take charge.

368
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,220
I really see the problem.

369
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,960
Because, you know, so you can have this

370
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,240
seal.

371
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,180
You know, everyone can solve this problem of

372
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,140
this missile crisis, you know.

373
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,940
Because, you know, the different war is terrible.

374
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,360
Because, you know, remember, well, it's not a

375
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:24,460
drug.

376
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,060
It was terrible.

377
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:25,800
It was 50 years.

378
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,820
In fact, it took me to the last

379
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,240
three years.

380
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,060
But there's not a decreshing date.

381
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,960
So the date between us, you know, there's

382
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,840
been five years.

383
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,540
Now it's 50 years.

384
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,420
Now the situation has passed.

385
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,480
The situation has passed.

386
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
I am now holding a torch.

387
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,220
I'm not a torch bearer, you know.

388
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,320
Don't worry about Nami Kano.

389
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,040
Nami Kano doesn't understand what I'm doing.

390
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,160
I'm doing something else.

391
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,600
I'm doing stuff.

392
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,700
I'm actually building stuff.

393
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,420
You know, he's like doing stuff.

394
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,060
He's like my one.

395
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,800
I'm a rebel.

396
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,180
But I'm not in the rebel in that

397
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,160
sense of the word.

398
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,300
I'm a rebel.

399
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,380
But I'm in the right way.

400
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,620
You know, I'm repairing the way that cannot

401
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,120
be broken down easily.

402
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,240
You know, that's what I'm saying.

403
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,520
I'm telling you, this is the birth 19th

404
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,160
of May, 2001.

405
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,720
1905, you know, Generation Z, Gen Z.

406
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,720
You know, go Gen Alpha.

407
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,540
You know, those people in Nigeria, they're fucking

408
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,520
up the whole time.

409
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,960
They're messing things up.

410
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,240
This is Pandora's backs.

411
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,020
Pandora cried.

412
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
She rubbed and shuddered.

413
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,960
And the tears bled until she passed out.

414
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,120
You know, she became a maniac in the

415
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,220
end.

416
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,960
You know, she became a mechanic.

417
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,940
Because, you know, the infantry did not sustain

418
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,240
her.

419
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,300
And she just got older and died.

420
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,220
Why?

421
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,580
Because no one 25, 50 years old is

422
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,580
too old for Nami Kano.

423
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,440
You know.

424
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,440
You know, I mean, people like young women,

425
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:33,720
you know.

426
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,520
But, you know.

427
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,380
In Nigeria, you can get 50 million times

428
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:36,920
in a different manner.

429
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,840
But you have to have stability.

430
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:38,440
You know.

431
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,020
She's not stable.

432
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:39,480
You know.

433
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,520
She can be powerful, yes.

434
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,720
But she doesn't have that alignment.

435
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,540
Because the government around her has changed.

436
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,080
Everything has changed.

437
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:45,500
You know.

438
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,940
She can't get anyone.

439
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:47,660
You know.

440
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,880
If she wants to marry or have a

441
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,020
child.

442
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,280
It's not that bad.

443
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,360
That has to.

444
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,680
That has to mean the story.

445
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,320
That's it.

446
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,620
For the magical implication.

447
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,880
That's what it means to have an aura

448
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,300
seal.

449
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:57,680
You know.

450
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,000
Their aura was a change.

451
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,200
Their change was us, was them.

452
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:00,800
You know, them.

453
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,360
But them was not us.

454
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:02,860
You know.

455
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,780
We are different from them.

456
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,460
That's what it's them.

457
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:04,680
Us.

458
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,380
We can be them.

459
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:05,820
But you know.

460
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,400
Them doesn't mean us.

461
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:06,660
Because you know.

462
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,620
I want something.

463
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,960
We are against each other.

464
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,080
And this is the real world.

465
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:10,380
You know.

466
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,260
We are fighting against systematically.

467
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,000
By design.

468
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,980
By how fragmented the ecosystem is.

469
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,120
How you can buy carbon.

470
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,640
Buy food.

471
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,620
I can't find water.

472
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:18,880
You know.

473
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,380
That's kind of thing.

474
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,860
I want to heal as well.

475
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,140
You know.

476
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,100
I want this as a policy.

477
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:23,980
In that thing.

478
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,440
And everything invariant wants to be.

479
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,120
I'm going to put that there.

480
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,160
Sorry, no sir.

481
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,920
Everything is inferior.

482
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,280
I want to cover the foundation.

483
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,440
You know.

484
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,780
You know.

485
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,160
My constitution.

486
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,420
Don't worry about the summit.

487
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,640
At least by killing people.

488
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,240
I don't want to kill people.

489
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:41,880
I want to build people.

490
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,100
You know.

491
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:42,800
If I can.

492
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,240
It's not about empathy for me.

493
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,200
I'm not.

494
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,080
I'm a competition.

495
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,140
I'm a scientist.

496
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:47,960
I'm a scientist.

497
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,400
It's about end result.

498
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:50,940
And that's what I'm saying about.

499
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,300
You know.

500
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,560
I don't have to fail you.

501
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,020
You know.

502
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:53,760
I know.

503
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,320
I'm autistic.

504
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,360
As per just.

505
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,620
This is what this law system means to

506
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:57,960
me.

507
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,960
My greatest capacity.

508
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,140
My healing begins.

509
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,200
My journey.

510
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,320
My time is now.

511
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,260
My healing begins.

512
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:03,900
You know.

513
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm not talking to you guys.

514
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,300
You know.

515
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:05,820
I'm talking to myself.

516
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,000
This is for a moment for myself.

517
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,220
You know.

518
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:07,840
I'm not being.

519
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,520
I don't care.

520
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:08,940
I don't care.

521
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,600
I don't have values.

522
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,600
I don't know who's the beast.

523
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,380
Who wants me to be.

524
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:12,880
You know.

525
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:13,700
I have a room.

526
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:14,780
You want to see my room?

527
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,280
No.

528
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,140
Come on.

529
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,120
I'm here for you.

530
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:17,820
Anyway.

531
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,400
Look.

532
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,620
I'm part of a mentor.

533
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,780
I have ADHD.

534
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,060
As per just autism and disability.

535
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,560
And this autism stuff.

536
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,700
Talking about the modern body.

537
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,960
And we shouldn't have.

538
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,340
What is it.

539
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:29,780
What's stop.

540
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:30,860
They can't do anything.

541
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:31,820
They must stop.

542
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,440
I'm seeing those people.

543
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,760
I can see you.

544
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,140
I'm not seeing people that don't do that

545
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:35,360
to me.

546
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,040
You know.

547
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,260
And I'm going to leave this UK.

548
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,720
And when I come to Nigeria.

549
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,660
I'm going to fix this.

550
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,120
My aura.

551
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,560
My aura.

552
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,880
