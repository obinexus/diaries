uh under the sorry under the housing act 1998 uh the social health and social care act uh which was 
enforce 2014 uh uh when I was 15 years old. Uh I was my name is Nami Abala. I was born uh 19th of May 2001. 
I was looking for housing uh uh health and social care through Vir and the housing team. 
Uh right now I'm uh 15 way uh supportive accommodation. 
Um I need to um clarify some things cuz uh council can twist uh a lot of stories. 
Um a lot of things uh it's just a a lot of things happened in my life and I I just clarify um why 
I'm recording this video. Uh I'm before this video because of this uh uh because of my case number um against 
thorough counsel uh thorough counsel um um you know I've been with them since I was 9 years old uh I social care 
uh and health cuz I was autistic. I have autism uh diagnutism uh when I was um 10 years old I was um uh part of 
gifted and talented program. No is 11. Yes 11 years old. Uh given talent program 2 percentile of intelligent children. Um so if you if you type in British MEA uh MEA is a company that um I advocates for people who are um 
neurody divergent including them but they have failed me in the recent past days. Yes. Uh but you know uh for me 
uh uh I had a I I done a SAT an uh SAT uh introductory SAT uh uh uh when I was in 
St. James in New Ham uh central London. Uh then I moved to Forest Gate uh which was meant to be actually 
artistic school but it never was artistic a different school 
I went to uh uh from Forest Gate which is which isn't the right school I went to but 
you know um it was the wrong school uh secondary school so I said so I done two 
assessments SAT uh primary school and SAT secondary school under me standards test uh 
just introductory test but they they don't know this but um I'm part of Mensa 2% of I joined 
Mensa um uh via Frost Gate and which I believe is St. James but not not 
St. James know cuz you know that was done in um F but it could have been St. 
I don't know how this is fully work. Um but you know I done the mess IQ test. 
So I came out um two percentile of 90. So my my um 140 uh 140 plus uh people people are normal 
people are 120 average people but I have a high IQ uh uh but to me it's just a metric uh which can scale. 
It's a dynamic metric or delicate scaling system for IQ which is really um which is really can change in 
any region and time space you know based on people's experiences uh you know a lot of things can happen people 
can be smart you know but uh this is a very but you know I'm record this video because of um something uh I want to show 
you on my computer u my point right now is uh I'm looking for housing under health and social care uh I'm 
I'm trying to sue council I'm actually seeing council uh 18 to 24 years old of social care my life. 
Um cuz I got my um bachelor degree uh I got my master's degree um I got my bachelor degree uh in computer science. 
I have my uh M I'm going to do my masters at Cambridge uh for 1st October about 2024 sorry 25 uh yes uh

I find disgusting and uh it's really disgusting and I didn't want to help anyone or support you in any shape or form. Uh uh okay um let me just like uh be be frank with you. 
Uh last year uh August uh to throw council lost uh several million pounds uh several in a in a 
scandal um for uh for investing in uh solar winds. They tried to invest in nuclear energy instead of 
building homes. uh 7 million 700 million pounds the maximum they lost uh can built um 
8,000 flats and people who have autism with lack of capacity uh but would not know that they don'
t have a house or not have property you know cuz they can stay in a in a hostel or flat uh like you 
know like you know this kind of accommodation where they can keep them and they can be uh say they 
are happy they have home cuz they cuz they don't know the difference if they don't have capacity they don't 
understand owning a property and uh owning um sorry owning a property and owning a and living in a hostel or 
unlike me which I know very well or cuz I read the human rights I read the policies 
I read everything which they want to start uh harassing more people uh but you know 
I'm not going to have that so let me just uh let me just like um uh give you a brief 
overview so 18 to4 I've been a lot of social care services uh from uh TLS uh 
70way road uh uh I did I got when I was in there uh 17 
I came back to from mental institution when I was uh 15 
years old to 16 foster care. for foster care I went to um from 
foster care I went back to thro for housing 17 18 years old 
they forgot about me six months uh they went to give me a 
house under uh capacity act they didn't even need to do a 
capacity assessment because you know uh as for property 
they didn't want to give me a property but I still pursue 
I got my um diploma in computer science I got my um that's my level two diploma 
in IC computer science ICT I got my um bachelor degree um uh which is 
Oxford related now uh that's my level three uh which is more application 
that theory uh computer science OB Nexus OB next is my business OB equals heart 
uh Nexus equals connection so I got those two things uh now I got my bachelor degree but they evicted me from the campus uh my level two I couldn't get my level three I have to do my level three online they didn't give me any for just evicting me so I'm suing the status college for for malreating me and abusing my human rights and to education uh but you know I've been plotting this uh since I was 18 years old anyway because I know it's disgusting I know uh how listen work more than them uh I've made several GDP request uh before I'm releasing thous abuse of my dignity human rights as a child 9 years old uh no making thinking my autism is a is a defect more than uh something to amplify and uh excel but this is how they are um these councils they always been like this um from the very first day uh they step in there in those councils working council offices so uh so the so if you don't know there are 30 human rights uh human rights uh 1 to 30 the 30 human rights I demand 1 million pounds for each human right uh for vi legal legal team cuz I'm trying to run my business uh then so I'm doing a 1 million human violation you know they molest me they touch me they harass me they don't care I was homeless to November January I came back I lost £10,000 in my bank account looking for housing uh looking for stability again for 3 months I stayed in a in a in accommodation um so 30 human rights violated under child being alien hospital without assessment. Uh two two seconds didn't two seconds didn't assess me. Uh they never assess me uh just put me there cuz I said I saw a UFO uh which I lied uh to get uh independent property uh because they know how they are. So I lied to them uh once and I never did again because the institution I just uh tried to and they never told my right to independence my right to independent you put you there uh forever you know I was on section zero I wasn't on any sectioning I was a neutral entity uh in that uh went to hospital I was there for um six uh 3 months I believe to get me out but they I stayed there for over a year uh 15 to 16 I came out when I was uh oh I think it was 2 years actually 15 to 17 I don't No, but um I believe it was 3 years. Um I was ser um for 15 to 17 years old. Uh 15 16 17 uh no yeah I believe it was 2 years old but I don't want to I'm I'm not very sure of that. So by by know 16 years old I stayed 16. I came down one year later uh 3 months I passed. So I came out I did my um I did my uh because you know but I was uh I was like a very unstable mentally. Uh didn't do anything about when you ask for housing they don't care you know. I was back in foster care. So I didn't even like uh but you know I done my independent certificate uh but there's no part I got my independent certificate at my trust foundation in uh in Kent uh when they put me for foster care. Then I came across for my independence but I don't my teacher she didn't want to help me cuz I kissed three months in uh 178 uh when I was 18 years old uh the last uh 17 18 I saw the loss 13 million pounds in a lawsuit. I never know lawsuit to uh in a in a in a legal matter, you know, you know, cuz they just uh keep funing money out of the the people's mind, the people's fun. Uh so they got they lost that money online. I don't know how they lost that money, but that's just on the news on BBC news. If you search uh 433 434 um£434 money they lost somehow on council they lost that. I don't even know why what happened but you know it was kind of brief cuz I was trying to move on my life. Then I stayed in social care. I could have just went to the UKcast platform and got my I didn't have any money, didn't have anything. So, I just had to uh advocate for myself. So, I got my um level two degree uh in three scholarship. But my second one, I couldn't get my second one, my second level three degree, my three through the me I can't get to based to make me seem I can't get to I did get to uh but you know to appeal decision I can't get you know they just keep abusing me. So I still got my level three through online services but as for regulated uh I still press charges against sus college and all the health and care providers they couldn't help me enforcing stupid policy that policy that policy uh without any uh way to uh attain a a clear milestone in the public sector. Uh health care is a public sector but they don't really um uh people that understand don't understand that this is a real world. You can't just um just can't you can't just um make those kind of mistake and be a bureaucrat you know you you're not the one you're not the one making decision you know it's not your choice to make you know it's that individual's future it's not your it's not yours to take on his path role and you cannot do that so right now uh I'm looking at some documents on my computer I'm just like a uh uh um yes uh this what I wrote with AI but you know I put into AI but it's like um Um yes a lot of things. So let me just give you this document. Uh let's um legal case summary node. This is May is what current amutism is as this is not this not really true cuz they just diagnos everything just to make sure you have medication you know they don't care you know they don't care about the support you know. Uh this is my violated uh article 3 article um uh uh three is when I was a measure uh which um and then uh that's what it says and then uh they keep it there. I think it was year you know I was there for too long you know I I don't even know I was just being it was one year I believe one year 30 but I didn't get my data to see how how this but you know equality right children living care uh financial compensation so 100 million 120 million uh uh you know cuz you know they don't want to do anything and I'm speaking myself of the story don't understand I don't care what they understand uh the cycle of I call it the cycle of oppression and depression you know uh hence the song might stop here cuz I I you look at my life uh from me, myself, and I. Uh, my dystopia. Sorry. My dystopia. Let me try to find this. Okay. So, this is a I'm getting off track now, but this is what I mean by it's a poem. It's a song. You know, my it's an album I want to work on. It's a it's a song album, you know. It's a called My Dystopia. Uh, album one is an cycle repeats, the repressive cycle. And the album two is a Back to Survival No More State. Uh, and this what uh the album is. You got uh number one, Pitch Perfection, cuz Pitch Perfection is just a a song about pitch perfection. I've been having a perfect pitch. You know, I had this ability when I was young uh to know each note in a s track, you know, know what they mean, you know, feel the weight from a different have the pitch because it's a it's a valid uh a lot of people have, but you know, uh I can't really make music cuz I don't have fans, but you know, I can make music. I try and do it. Um but you know, that's what it is on second repeat and look at 10 and continues. You know, I can live my life with free uh independence, autonomy, etc. Uh so um let's go back to the um let's go back to the um uh um the the the topic. Um so right now um I I got some other documents to share uh with you. Um let me just find them. Um um housing complaints. Uh yes uh this is one um appeal. Uh yes uh uh my first appeal. Uh I am writing race component health care act housing act customized act uh 28 gener uh blah blah blah blah so this unsafe and location conditions abs of uh limited privacy and you guys don't come to my bedroom this accommodation I'm in uh further uh sut GDPR you know GDPR is a formal request pro about and they didn't want to give me too much to do when they lost um a single sum of money but this Uh this is something called uh uh this is the first uh appeal I did you know my right to appeal under health and social care. Uh now now I'll give you my right to um my housing review. Uh this is my housing review. Um yes a full uh housing act 196 uh uh section 202 uh you know they didn't want to give me so uh section 202 allows me to review the decision in 12 weeks 8 days. I can get um three if he doesn't know in 7 weeks. Uh 12 21 days I uh 21 days I go to court with them. Uh 21 days that's 3 weeks they meant to get me out of here in 3 weeks because the council uh they're part of the local community and they have to advocate for me cuz they put me on homelessness here. But you know the law keeps losing money. They don't care. So 21 days has passed and they didn't want to do anything. So I have the right to now press more charges against the council under section 202. Now they are say I'm not homeless again. So this uh this is the uh this is the other one as amended 6184. You're requested to uh blah blah uh uh uh right to review housing. Uh you said you have the right to review decision if you're happy with decision blah blah. Uh uh uh but you know she's like um this is a lady that I met talk to on the on the she's doubling down uh on it. Uh she's saying me uh I don't I'm not homeless. I say I'm homeless. I don't want to have my hotel. It's not available to me cuz it's not it's a fight. It's not uh it's not suitable. It's just a room. Uh it's not a property. It's just a bedroom. If I own the property, I want a house. I want a full property. I don't want to be watched. You know, it's my property. write to review. Uh so this is the first one she sent the housing solution officer. Uh so this the other one she sent but this not the full story here. Five is nothing cuz it's five bedroom of uh a fiber of of useless uh uselessness. Uh they don't want to uh do anything on my behalf. Help me anyone. It's really disgusting. Uh and then she sent me this email. Uh oh, this is the same one. Oh, this is a longer one. Oh my days. You know. Yes. Yes. This is says a refer refusal to sign key documents. Yes. Uh this one I will not sign uh these the key documents cuz you know I'm homeless. I'm claiming I'm homeless cuz know I don't want to pay for this property. Uh cuz you know this is void. Therefore I will not sign it cuz if I sign the document I will then making uh look I'm homeless. If I sign that document I everyone say oh why do you sign it? You are not homeless you know and then have to wait for the contract to expire. My contract is one year only. I won't sign it any way shape or form whether it's complete or not. I don't sign it. Uh I don't care about medication cuz it's just a thought. I just want to control people. I know that you know I only take medication when I need medication when I feel disturbed or but you know I know how to control it. Uh refuse I never refused to attend a meeting.

Civil collapse equals uh you know civilian collapse. No one's building anything. No one's doing anything. Just being surveiled. Watch. Uh there's no path to independence. Uh this is civilian collapse. It's just a political term that affects the people. There's no there's no support by councils anything. It's a civilian matter. Uh civilian issue civil including civilian civil just means uh civil community staff for not involving crime giving crime anything to do with civilian not like military or anything.

It's a internal uh uh collapse of uh of people and this is my on behalf of everyone service civil collapse living under civil collapse. This is a collapse have no power no direction get my masters in Cambridge where I know I will get my masters uh but you know I have to I'm looking for grants uh visual Cambridge you know I'm looking for someone to uh recognize my engineers so I can build the something called ontological basian infrastructure inference infrastructure uh for AI which is um which is a AI system that is um which is the old band from anyway through council health care everyone abused me in the past and I'll find them I'll make sure they can never use my services my business anything ob still building But you know I lost the money to build it. You know whether I do it or not. They don't care. I don't care about what the service do. Don't respect people. Uh I don't respect them. You know I can't give someone respect without having respect myself. It's uh respect is recip respect is reciprocal like they all say you know they're going to try to uh take this video and twist my words and and pretend like I never said this but you know ni you're the one that can do this do this now. Talk to myself. It's my advocacy because for me it's my good thing. I talk to myself. Um for me this is my true self like talking to myself you know this is the video it's not even for you to see people to see cuz it's easy you can see the video anytime you want you know but you know it's for me to remember the trauma that caused me and why I'm doing this you know cuz me I I am that means I'm self learning everything I do for myself cuz myself is really important myself you know my care my everything you know uh one more thing I have to show you guys um my email I can show you guys I don't care show you guys my email it's you know we can check this we can check this email anytime you know I don't care you know I could just hack this emails nowadays, you know, it's it's nothing to uh to really uh be um be uh be be um be like, you know, like not showing, you know, cuz you know, if you know, if I'm a hacker, you know, you know, cuz I have a you know, for me personally, my up you know, I want to tell you something, you know, in the legal team, we have a constructive and deconstructive proof system. You know, say someone make a statement that Nambdi was not homeless. You know, I then said, "Okay, how do you prove that I was not homeless from November 20th January. You know, how can you prove that? You know, they can't with this system cuz you know, this is a legal matter. So, uh I have to be very careful. I was in Best Western uh uh £32 a week. I paid that in Best Western uh hotel in West Turk. Uh I used £10,000 plus to play that money uh um uh per per day, per week. I paid best western put one point for one five months and then because there was some tension running in the hotel I don't want to pay I don't want to pay I then moved to premier in I and paid uh £372 the same amount per day I paid that at best western uh just to stay in that uh hotel to not be on the street uh cold suffering etc. Uh but I stay there. Um I stayed there with all my items, all my belongings and I and then I moved my luggage uh and then moved all my luggage to um and then sorry my head is then I move all of my luggage to um to to to the the 15 is way uh via the transfer service. Well, while I was looking for while I was looking for um while I was looking for accommodation myself, but I didn't tell them cuz you know I know I know how these things work. But you know I I didn't call I didn't call the homelessness team cuz uh 20 November there's no support because you know it's getting to Christmas you know people are shutting down the services just for the Christmas holiday but I survived the homelessness or jail line. I was like I was very furious cuz that business money I stay for two years in my pip uh personal appointment university credit uh which I paid um which I legally by mirror to buy through council via thor approval uh and closed my contract was uh was violated and I clos my social care contract uh 23 years old I was 23 years old 2019 24th of May 2001 uh then I closed my uh third contract then after that I I came back to um I came back to social care and I asked for a house you know in the quick I know the system gets better. get a better he said no cuz people who make G don't even know how to decide some things uh that's right you know so health care health care which became a sector in 2014 uh when 15 years old uh health and care provide uh mental health sector uh didn't even know it but their sector uh and then uh uh uh keep abusing people and even a sector or not uh and they couldn't give help me house help me anywhere so I said that is fine you know for me I played I play like a I play I didn't play dumb but I keep track I kept track of everything you know whether they say it or not internally on paper on record you know I can provide that evidence I like it rather too if they respect my GP request if they see me as human being because you know in court um this guy blow up you know blow up you know whether they like it or not you know you know I'm disclosing this to the um you know they say I don't have capacity everything but you know I know exactly what's happening you know you know cuz you know this is my time this is my time to shine this is my time to get myself. Um this is my last chance at a my my last attempt at a home when looking for a home when I was 18 years old. you know, when I when I've been homeless 18 years old, uh, you know, but they don't care and I don't care, you know, it's going to be like a little tickle uh for their own business bank account, you know, but you know, when I come to my account, people are going to get houses, you know, whether they like it or not, you know, it's not high-rise, nothing, you know, we're going to build flat structures on the floor, you know. I said I need a one piece line, one piece of land cuz I'm homeless. My sign, they turn me away, say I ment you know, hence the constru the no. me stable what me stability you want to define everything you do define your life everything how you go how you act but I'm not I'm not like that I'm not like that so how the system works for example if I was homeless I got a receipt everything let's say I was not homeless cuz you know they didn't abuse my human rights but I said I was homeless and I want to sell me in and I lo my 3D printer everything so let me show right now it's a bit messy but you know I don't care what you say about my desk I'm working so I like that I got my bookshelf uh so this is my bookshelf all the books I read, I study it. Uh yes, and this is my uh this is my bag, my punching bag with some items. And this my uh this one is my um 3D printer. Uh this is a 3D printer I bought. And that's my PC which I put and use for my computer cuz I'm building a robot doing a robot uh my do my masters. I'm taking a grant uh at Cambridge. I told him all of this. I'm part of 2%. I don't care whether they care. I don't care what they what they do. But you know, don't don't infra my human rights my my my don't infra my human rights even. Don't don't even don't even try to uh uh uh try to try try to play you don't know. Don't even try to um because you know I got you where I want you and I and and I will and and I and I will take legal matter legal action whether you like it or not you know you know whether you feel is justified or unjustified you know cuz it's my life and my life is not a joke should not be a joke to anyone that you know and please uh people like me J you know you have to understand your right to look at one thing they've done wrong in your policy nothing if it's a council nothing you know if you're if you're 15 14 15 now 13 12 you uh go online look at what council policy start using your account advantage start applying for social housing you know you can just log with your email account uh create an email account like Google account you know free uh register as a young child or something like something like an email private email you know advocate yourself you're the best allocator so you know what you want you know that's how you put it you know what you want you're the best for yourself if you don't know what you want then and you can ask someone else what you want but you shouldn't ask people what you want to know what you want uh so I'm saying that um so what I'm saying to you is like find your local like wants to counsel put me in offer now pay for my care. I don't want them to pay for anything I do, you know, I don't like their business. Uh then for use for the service your advances, look for housing services, library for the housing service register for if you turn 18. If you turn 18 and you don't get a house, you can sue the council. You know, everything just money, you know, that's how the law is working. You know, look at the policy, everything. You said documentary I said 6 months is what it takes to get a house in housing act 1960. You know, they pretend like social care is too much. It's social care is too much. But people that don't have the capacity, they only know housing speak for housing, you know, honestly want to do social care too, you know. uh which they which they don't want to do anything which I don't care but I have a bachelor degree in computer science I'm doing my masters I'm doing ABC and I went to Cambridge uh anyway to do get a property let me give me a let me get an email too so so they cannot prove anything uh that I did wrong but you know um so so that's what you just pretend like it's a joke um and I did request request sever several data from them uh uh but you know going to pretend I didn't do that like I don't have the capacity to make my own request but but it's it's it's too much it's too They're going to pretend autism is a liability, you know. Where's the liability? You're the liability. You know, you keep losing our money, you know. They keep losing so much money. They don't don't care and I don't care, you know, cuz all my business they know my business limits off off limits to them. I I I'm not venting. I'm just recording. I'm just documenting my life. You know, when I see venting, you know, you know, six years homeless. I was homeless for six years, you know, under house and social care. I don't I don't have a house. Tell me I have a house. I know what a house is. You have a house. I I know what that is. I know you know even the people that don't have capacity you know they can just say people that even waking up you know say oh yeah it's not a house I can't do everything I want to do you know and that's the council you know I've never I've never seen anybody uh tell tell them that um that the council help them uh you know fun they can happy and happy to work with the council and get a job at the council uh but that's how I am I don't care I don't care about their uh anything they say you know cuz you know I'm pressing more charges you know you have to tell them that job, everything. You know, those people there, you know, you can tell them what they want, but you know, um but you shouldn't tell them how to do it. Uh wait, paper trail. Sorry.
